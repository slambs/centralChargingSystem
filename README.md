## Central Charging System- plug.control
by V.S

This is a project that aims to create a simple Backend for to control store visualise charging processes for electric cars.
Written in Javascript. And tested on a X-Charge - C2EU - AC Charging Station.

Starting Point:

* OCPP 1.6 -J
* Server written in node.js using the ws module
* X-Charge C2EU are used for testing.
* central system adress (adress of the server) is the http://192.168.0.23:9016 

Update 6.5   /// I can now display some of the messages that Keba sends on the console log
Update 14.5  /// In order to have more control on the wsdl service generated and the I will try strong-soap, found out it is mainly                    for programming clients and only has a mock-server
Update 22.5  /// First test with a new Charging Station (XCharge) over websockets and OCPP 1.6

- think of an App structure . index.html
- design the ui and the basic functionalities
- test the whole thing
- write about what you did, how you overcame all these little problems and why you think the code works
- save data to mongo.db


notes
------
probably useful links( It may be useful to clean the links from time to time if you don't remember using them)
* node.js http // html ( https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_message_rawheaders )
* one page or multiple? Boilerplate?
